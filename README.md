# Code
Basic functionallity to generate the results in the paper. If further
explanation is wanted, see the extensive Matlab `help` each function
has. See the *Examples* section below for explicit usecases and figure
generation.

## Data (/data/)
To access data, run `d = loadData(rep)` where `rep` is a specificed
source, see `help loadData`. Note: not all sources listed are
distributed. Raw .csv files are stored under `/data/sources/REP` for
the source `REP`. We often use pre-processing steps on the data before
performing any calculations, e.g.,
```
Data = loadData('C19');
Data = polishData(Data,'D','Dinc',1);
Data = smoothData(Data,{'D' 'H' 'W'},{'Dinc' [] []});
```

## Kalman filter (/kalman/)
The main function for the Kalman filter is `C19filt(...)`. The
function makes further calls to subordinate functions found in
`/kalman/auxil/` that handle the construction and the recursive
propagation of the filter.

An evaluation of the prediction capabilities of the posterior Kalman
filter is obtained by `C19filt_lag(...)`, which is the Kalman filter
extended to enable k-day ahead ("lag") predictions, i.e., without data
observations.

## Prior (/inference/)
`rates = priorenger(N)` returns `N` samples from the prior, and `dens
= priorenger(rates)` computes the prior density of the samples in
`rates`.  The marginal priors are constructed in the `genprior`
script.

## Posterior (/inference/)
The posterior is stored and accessed using `rates =
posteriorenger(file)` where `file` is a posterior file.  We have
stored our generated posterior files under `inference/results/`. The
function includes a functionallity of referencing a list of posterior
files and sampling from a weighted average of them, e.g., the Swedish
national average weighted by regional population size.

## KLAM (/inference/KLAM/)
We generate samples from the approximate posterior by an
implementation of Kalman Likelihood Adaptive Metropolis (KLAM). We
supply the wrapper script `klam_parachain` which calls the underlying
functions (`klam_init`, `AM`, `logKL`) using Matlab's `parfor`
framework. Generating samples are expensive and we include the code
for reference, but the results we have generated can also be accessed by
the posterior functionality discussed above.
```
nMCMC = 1e3; % number of samples per chain
savetofile = false; % save the posterior or not
                    % (in either case RATES is created)
reg = 2; % Uppsala region
gelmanRub = true; % convergence score
burnin = 1e0; % burnin length to remove from chain
runs = 4; % number of parallel chains
register = 'C19'; % source of data
klam_parachain;

% reproduce the results in the paper
nMCMC = 5e4;
burnin = 1e3;
reg = 1:21;
savetofile = true;
klam_parachain;
```

## DynOpt (/inference/dynamic_beta/)
The temporal upscaling ("bootstrap on the margin") of the 4-week
reproduction number is generated by `dynamic_beta_ML`. Note that if
`savetofile = true`, the script might overwrite files.
```
reg = 2; % Uppsala
evalplot = true;  % diagnostic plots
savetofile = false;
register = 'C19'; % source of data
dynamic_beta_ML;  % generates R_t for Uppsala upscale,
                  % see the variable R_POST

reg = 1:21 % all regions
evalplot = false;
% generates the files for all the regions:
dynamic_beta_ML;

% generates the weighted national average posterior:
dynamic_beta_ML_all;
```

## Weekly predictions (/weekly/)
We perform k-day ahead prediction using the posterior Kalman filter in
`weekly_prediction`, for an example, see Fig. 3 in the paper.

## Bootstrap (/URDME/)
The boostrap replicates we use for assessing robustness are generated
using URDME. The URDME-model script `covid19enger` defines the rates
and the model itself and `covid19enger_run_post` simulates the
samples. Our posterior samples are generated using a national weighted
mean posterior. See the example for Fig. S8 below for some sample
code. The following example will generate the bootstrap replicate
samples, infer one posterior using KLAM on that data for the Uppsala
region, and finally perform the upscaling of the reproduction number
on that posterior. *NOTE* this is time consuming.
```
savetofile = true;
dynamic_beta_ML_all; % if not already run
regplot = [];
URDMEsampling; % generates data

reg = 2;
register = 'URDME1'
klam_parachain
urdme = 1;
dynamic_beta_ML;
```

# Examples (paper/predict/)
All the examples are referenced to a presented figure in the paper.

Prior to generating the figure, simulation files are needed for some
the figures/examples listed below. In order to run the properly we
suggest you first generate them by first running the `laggen` script.
It will take a while, but it needs only to be called once. The
`laggen` call should be called as follows
```
% *suggested approach* to reproduce the Figures in the paper.
type = 1;
reg = [1 2 22];
laggen;
type = 2;
reg = [2]
laggen;

% if all data is wanted
type = 1;
reg = 1:22;
laggen; % filter output + 14 days of prediciton

type = 2;
laggen % Continous 7-day ahead prediction

```

## Figures (paper/predict/img/scripts)
### Fig. 2:
Illustrate the marginal prior and posterior with
`prior_posterior`. The illustration can be the weighted national
average or any combination of regional posteriors, see the variable
`reg` which include all if set to `[1:21]` or only Uppsala if `[2]`.
```
savetofile=false;
reg = [1:21]
prior_posterior; % generates the weighted national average, as in the paper.

reg = [2]
prior_posterior; % generates the same but only for Uppsala.
```
### Fig. 3:
7-day ahead predictions per region, and exemplified for Uppsala in
`lagplot`. The function unpacks prediction samples generated using
`weekly_predict` wrapper `laggen`

```
savetofile=false;
generateData=0; % if the laggen call was already made
reg = [2]; % Uppsala figure, [1] for Stockholm and so on.
lagplot;

```

### Fig. 4:
The proportion of recovered invididuals per region, and Stockholm in
particular `recovered`. Stockholm in particular because we have
included validating sources which themselves only consider that
region. The validating sources are included by .csv: [`fhmAnti`,
`fhmAntiGivare`, `RecPaperEstimate`], see the paper for the sources.
The call is simply
```
savetofile=false;
recovered; % generates the recoverd plot in the paper.
```

### Fig. 5 (& 7)
The posterior reproduction number (4-week) and the marginal boostrap
(daily) per region can be illustrated by `Rposterior`. In which the
region of interest is specified by `reglist`. In Fig. 5 `= [2]`, and
in Fig. S2 `= [1 10 12 8 9 19]`. The 4-week posterior is illustrated
using a boxplot, the daily as a red line, and for comparison (or
validation) we also include the estimate given by PHA per region.
```
clear reg
savetofile=false;
Rposterior; % generates the figures for the 7 regions in the paper

reg = [2]
Rposterior; % only generates the figure for Uppsala
```

### Fig. 6:
As the posterior Kalman filter can give an estimate of the proportion
of recovered individuals, similarly the filter can also give an
estimate of the number of symptomatic or the symptomatic
incidence. The latter is often what servailence studies (testing)
tries to uncover. In `IincFac` we do exactly this, we recover the
symtomatic incidence and compare it to the positive tests by PHA in
Stockholm and Uppsala. Figures can be generates in batch, or by region.
```
savetofile = false;
reg = [1] % Stockolm
IincFac;

savetofile = true; % the figure names are re-used and we suggest saving.
reg = [1 2] % Stockholm and Uppsala
IincFac;
```

### Fig. 9:
The pre-processing of the data (as discussed under Results → Data)
corrects the distribution of diseased incidence per weekday to achieve
one that is closer to uniformly distributed. If not close to uniform,
it is telling to be a data entry issue as nothing intrisict about the
infection should decide that one day is >5 times likely to have more
reported deaths on. The illustration is reproducable in
`weekday_smoothing`.
```
savetofile=false;
reg = 1; % Stockholm
weekday_smoothing;

reg = 2; % Uppsala
weekday_smoothing;
```

### Fig. 11:
Our effort of exploring the prior predictive distribution is given in
`priorpred`. The parameters directly samples from the prior is used as
the ones from the posterior is used in `laggen`. A first inital run
should include `gendata = true` and then it can be set to `false`. The
first run generates the prior sample predictions and save the file (it
can be large, therefore we do not include it). After it has been
generated, the file can simply be loaded the the predictive
distribution can be explored further.
```
savetofile=false;
regen=1; % generate the samples
reg=2; % Uppsala | can be swapped for othe regions, e.g., Stockholm (1).
Nprior=1e3; % number of prior samples
priorpred;

regen=0;
priorpred; % same figure, but loading the prior samples from file.
```

### Fig. 12:
The daily estimate of β is expensive to run; superlinear in the number
of days *K*. We illustrate the splitting of horizions to make the
calculations feasable in `HorizonSplitCompare`. *WARNING* this script
takes a long time to compute.
```
savetofile=false;
reg=2; % Uppsala region, as in paper.
HorizonSplitCompare;

```

### Fig. 13:
The posterior for all regions is tricker to visualize all at once. In
`errorbarsRegion` we give the posterior mean ± 1 std per region. This
quick illustration gives a quick overview of potential outlier regions
but also the similarity between regional results.
```
clear ratenames
savetofile=false;
errorbarsRegion; % load data into memory and generate figure.

errorbarsRegion; % from memory generate figure.
```

### Fig. 14:
The bootstrap samples are, as mentioned, generated using URDME. The
function `URDMEsampling` generates the samples for all regions, stores
the file, and generates the figures. The latter allows for visualized
comparison with the underlying data. There will be some missmatch
assumed as the posterior we use in the simulations is a national
average (except per the reproduction number) and therefore if the
regional posterior differed significantly from the weighted national
average, we then expect the simulations to differ more.
```
savetofile=false;
reg = [1:21]; % national average
regplot = [2];
URDMEsampling; % Only the Uppsala figure

clear regplot
URDMEsampling; % All the figures in the paper.
```

### Fig. 15:
The reproduced posterior samples on the bootstrap replicate data can
we visualized together with the weighted national average (as Fig 2)
as another marginal density in `prior_posteriorURDME`.
```
savetofile=false;
reg = [1:21]; % national average
prior_posteriorURDME; % same figure as in the paper

reg = [2];
prior_posteriorURDME; % only for Uppsala.
```

### Fig. 16:
Similarly as the boostrap replicate posterior was compared to the the
marginal posterior and prior in Fig. S9, we can include the replicate
mean for the reproduction number in `RposteriorURDME`. We only include
the files necessary for the Uppsala region plot, as given in the
paper. The following results in the same figure.
```
savetofile=false;
RposteriorURDME;
```

### Fig. 17:
To compare the the Posterior Kalman filter predictor with something,
we construct a Autoregressive (AR) model in `arx_fit`. The AR model
considers data (H,W,D) in an expanding window and makes 7-day ahead
predictions. The performance is then evaluated on the frequency of
"inside [X%] CrI" and the NRMSE per the days we have recorded for the
Kalman filter. The reasoning for only doing it on the recorded dates
is that it makes sure that the Kalman filter had not seen "future"
data when making predictions. The code also generates the Tab. S5.
```
savetofile=false;
reg=2; % Uppsala region
arx_fit; % first time loads solution into memory

arx_fit; % no new fitting, only plotting
clear ypred;
reg=1; % Stockholm data
arx_fit; % fit anew.
```

## Tables (paper/predict/tab/scripts)
### Tab. 1
We describe in the paper how the research underlying the paper was
used, and developed, for weekly prediction in reports published for
the local authorities. The result from those reports are summarized in
a table and `weekly_eval` extracts the results.
```
savetofile=false;
weekly_eval; % reads the table
tableWeekly % the summarized and stored .tex table
```

### Tab. 2
The Infection Fatality rate (IFR), like the reproduction number, is a
4-week dynamical parameter. We present the IFR by the `IFRtableURDME`
script. The IFR update frequency of once per month (4-week) is however
not very stable (in a loose sense) and we decide to give the
bi-monthly estimate instead. Still, by including two months in the
estimate, we observe a downward trend forming. Per region, we give an
our estimate (posterior sample) for Stockholm and Uppsala. Next we
also give the weighted national average. The posterior CrI is computed
as the marginal quantiles. The table include footnotemarks (§ and ‡)
and we use these marks to indicate that the estimate should be
considered with care.
```
clear reg, bimonthly
IFRtableURDME; % generates the same table as in the paper

reg = [2]
IFRtableURDME; % only for Uppsala

reg = [1:22]; % all regions and Sweden
IFRtableURDME

reg = [2];
bimonthly = false;
IFRtableURDME; %Uppsala but IFR per month.
```

### Tab. S4
With the estimated bias, we compute the uncertainty statistics:
Coefficient of Variation (CoV), Coefficient of Bias (CoB), and
normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), per region in
`bootstraptable`. We estimate the bias for the regional posteriors by
using the known bias of the bootstrap replicates. The bias is computed
per parameter, and as a robust estimator of the bias for the entire
region (over all parameters) we give the median instead of the mean.
Deeper investigation into the working of the table construction is to
be done by examining `posterror` which processes the posterior files
that `bootstraptable` supplies it with.
```
saveetofile=false;
bootstraptable; % generates the table in the paper.
```

## Other
### CFR if [I,H,W]
In the paper we give estimates for the CFR when considering I, H, and
W. These esimates are generated using `spectral`.
```
reg=1:21; % national average
spectral; % same as in the paper

reg=2; % Uppsala CFR
spectral;
```

### Death per source compartment
For completion, we include the script for estimates of the number of
death per source compartment I, H or W: `Deadsplit`. By completion means that in
order to run the script a simulation output generated by an extended
version of our Kalman model that keep track of the different sources
that the diseased enter from. If necessary, we can happily share the
the additional code needed. Please contact the owner of the repository
to make that inquiry. *If the simulation file needed is available*
```
Deadsplit; % run spectral, and unpacks the simulation file.
```
